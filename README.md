## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my **continuous learning path in Embedded Systems**, covering theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and progressively advanced projects.

🎯 **Primary Goal:**  
Build a strong technical and research foundation to pursue a **Master’s degree in Computer Engineering / Embedded Systems**.

📍 The repository is organized to demonstrate:

- Solid understanding of low-level programming
- Hands-on experience with microcontrollers
- IoT system development
- Real-time and resource-constrained design
- Research-oriented mindset

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **bottom-up approach**:

1. Fundamentals of C programming  
2. Hardware interaction  
3. Microcontroller programming  
4. Communication protocols  
5. Real-time systems  
6. IoT and connected devices  
7. Advanced embedded architectures  

Each project aims to be:

- ✅ Well documented  
- ✅ Reproducible  
- ✅ Incrementally more complex  
- ✅ Relevant for academic research
